# Simple Example API using Express.js and PostgreSQL

ðŸš€ This repository provides a basic example of building a RESTful API using Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework, and PostgreSQL (PSQL), a powerful open-source relational database. This example demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a simple resource, such as "todos."

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful, open-source relational database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamuelFoc/PSQL-API.git
   ```
2. Install the APP
   ```bash
    npm install
   npm start
   ```
